Even though Israel is a small country it is always in the news.  The news continues to report on Jews moving to Israel, on
 the technology invented there, but also on conflict, wars and tensions with surrounding people.  Why? A look at Israel’s history
  in the book of Genesis in the Bible reveals that 4000 years ago a man, who is now very well known, went on a camping trip in that 
  part of the world.  The Bible says that his story affects our future.
Most of us wonder if there is a God and if He really is the God of the Bible. 
In the Bible God says ‘I will make your name great’ and today the name of Abraham/Abram is known worldwide. This promise has come true.
 The earliest copy of Genesis found in the Dead Sea Scrolls is dated 200-100 B.C. which means the promise has been in writing since at 
 least that time.
 At that time the name of Abraham was not well-known so the promise came true only after it was written down, not before.
